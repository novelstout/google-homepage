This project is part of the cirriculum for The Odin Project.

The focus of this project is to further knowledge and grasp the basics commands and functionality of HTML and CSS. This is achieved by deconstructing the Google homepage using developer tools in browser and then reassembling it via VSCode.

Skills used: HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. 

Notes:  For the most part, the project wasn't too hard to grasp. It's all about making sure your HTML and CSS are both structured in a way that nothing conflicts with one another. It took me around 7 days to build this, and while most of that time was due to life events getting in the way, a good portion was spent trying to understand Flexbox and figuring out the best units of measurement to use in certain areas. I went a little above and beyond with the placing of the searchbar icon as well as the shortcut icon in the header, but by doing so I learned how to use the link function in HTML and set an image using CSS. Still, my main take away was how to position elements using Flexbox and setting the width/height properties for the containers using viewport measurements.
